Sports-Reference.com CFB Data Extractor
=======================================

The kind folks at
[sports-reference.com](http://www.sports-reference.com) have quite a
bit of sports data available in nice HTML tables (which they are even
awesome enough to convert to CSV for you!). This repository simple
automates the process of downloading and manipulating the tables of
college football data.

Requirements
------------

This should work on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. External
requirements:

* [Tornado][] for asynchronous data downloading.
* [Pandas][] for data manipulation.

[Pandas]: http://pandas.pydata.org/
